      <p><span class="capitalize">S</span> hall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</p>
      <p><span class="capitalize">T</span>hou art more lovely and more temperate:</p>
      <p><span class="capitalize">R</span>ough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</p>
      <p><span class="capitalize">A</span>nd summer’s lease hath all too short a date;</p>
